## The prompt

well, I want to build the 1st project, and I want you to help me.
What I'm aiming for:
I'M TRYING TO "LEARN TO THINK" AS HOW A PROGRAMMER WITH A CREATIVE MIND WOULD DO, I NEED TO ARRIVE AT THE SOLUTION ON MY OWN, BE THE COMPASS THAT GUIDES ME NOT THE MAP THAT JUST TAKES ME TO THE END!
How I want you to help me:

rather than your using words (plain english) or handing me the solution code, I need you to find a similar case(scenario/question/problem-statement) to use a similar solution and break-it-down. So, I could write code my own way understanding your lesson and become the 'leonardo da vince' in programming, by the end of this road (finishing all the projects) I should be able to write programs from pseudo-code to clean code just as a person can speak his mother tongue (say "English" the way I can clearly communicate my end goal to you).
